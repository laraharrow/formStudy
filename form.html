          The purpose of a <strong>form</strong> is to allow users to input information and send it.
          The <strong>form</strong>'s action attribute determines where the form's information goes.
          The <strong>form</strong>'s method attribute determines how the information is sent and processed.
          To add fields for users to input information we use the <strong>input</strong> element and set the type attribute to a field of our choosing:
          Setting type to "text" creates a single row field for text input.
          Setting type to "password" creates a single row field that censors text input.
          Setting type to "number" creates a single row field for number input.
          Setting type to "range" creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
          Setting type to "checkbox" creates a single checkbox which can be paired with other checkboxes.
          Setting type to "radio" creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.
          Setting type to "list" will pair the <strong>input</strong> with a <strong>datalist</strong> element.
          Setting type to "submit" creates a submit button.
          A <strong>select</strong> element is populated with <strong>option</strong> elements and renders a dropdown list selection.
          A <strong>datalist</strong> element is populated with <strong>option</strong> elements and works with an <strong>input</strong> to search through choices.
          A <strong>textarea</strong> element is a text input field that has a customizable area.
          When a <strong>form</strong> is submitted, the name of the fields that accept input and the value of those fields are sent as name=value pairs.
          Using the <strong>form</strong> element in conjunction with the other elements listed above allows us to create sites that take in consideration the wants and needs of our users. Take the opportunity to take what you've learned and apply it!

        <h3>2. VALIDATION</h3>
        <p>
          To make sure your input gets filled by user use the attribute <strong>required</strong>
          <br/>
          This will give an alert if the user tries to submit the form without a value here.
        </p>
        <form action="/example.html" method="POST">
          <label for="allergies">Do you have any dietary restrictions?</label>
          <br>
          <input id="allergies" name="allergies" type="text" required>
          <br>
          <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>

        <p>
          Another built-in validation we can use is to assign a minimum or maximum value for a number field, e.g. <strong>input type="number"</strong> and <strong>input type="range"</strong>. To set a minimum acceptable value, we use the min attribute and assign a value. On the flip side, to set a maximum acceptable value, we assign the max attribute a value.
          <br/>
          To set a minimum number of characters for a text field, we add the minlength attribute and a value to set a minimum value. Similarly, to set the maximum number of characters for a text field, we use the maxlength attribute and set a maximum value.
        </p>
        <form action="/example.html" method="POST">
          <label for="guests">Enter # of guests:</label>
          <input id="guests" name="guests" type="number" min="1" max="4">
          <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>

        <p>
          In addition to checking the length of a text, we could also add a validation to check how the text was provided. For cases when we want user input to follow specific guidelines, we use the pattern attribute and assign it a regular expression, or regex. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that make up a search pattern. If the input matches the regex, the form can be submitted.
          <br/>
          Let's say we wanted to check for a valid credit card number (a 14 to 16 digit number). We could use the regex: [0-9]{14,16} which checks that the user provided only numbers and that they entered at least 14 digits and at most 16 digits. To add this to a form:
        </p>

        <form action="/example.html" method="POST">
          <label for="payment">Credit Card Number (no spaces):</label>
          <br>
          <input id="payment" name="payment" type="text" required pattern="[0-9]{14,16}">
          <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
      </div>
